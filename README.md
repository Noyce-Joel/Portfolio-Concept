## Portfolio Concept

This project serves as an example of what one can do with Three.js to create an intereactive personal website.

I enabled the user to navigate the canvas by manipulating camera controls with event listeners and R3F;
and I incorporated HTML using Drei to display copy. This allows users to choose a box and explore it's contents in 360 degrees.
